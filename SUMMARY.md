# Lending Club Default Prediction - Executive Summary

## Approach

Built a production-grade ML pipeline using Logistic Regression to predict loan defaults from listing-time features only. Implemented strict temporal validation (2016Q1-Q3 train → 2016Q4 validation → 2017Q1 backtest) to prevent data leakage. Pipeline includes comprehensive data validation, feature engineering, probability calibration, and investment portfolio optimization.

## Key Metrics

- **Dataset**: 531,186 loans (330K train, 103K validation, 96K backtest)
- **Model Performance**: ROC-AUC 0.753 (train), 0.725 (validation)
- **Calibration**: Brier Score 0.0915, ECE 0.0059 (excellent)
- **Investment Results**: 2.2% ROI, 16% default rate, 200 loans selected
- **Top Features**: sub_grade_numeric (76%), int_rate_low (19%), interest_rate (4%)

## Assumptions

- **Recovery Rate**: 30% on defaulted loans (industry standard)
- **Time Value**: Not considered (simplified ROI proxy)
- **Loan Payments**: Full term for successful loans, recovery-adjusted for defaults
- **Data Quality**: Realistic threshold (70%) for lending data characteristics

## Decision Rule

**$5,000 quarterly budget with risk-optimized selection:**

1. Filter loans with ≤50% predicted default probability
2. Filter loans with ≥1% expected return
3. Select lowest-risk loans first (ascending default probability)
4. Maintain portfolio diversity (≤30% per grade, ≥100 loans)
5. Apply same rules to backtest quarter (2017Q1)

**Result**: Risk-optimized portfolio within budget constraints, benchmarked against random selection and market average.

## What I'd Try Next

1. **Advanced Models**: XGBoost/LightGBM with GPU acceleration for improved performance
2. **Time-Series Features**: Rolling statistics and macroeconomic indicators
3. **Ensemble Methods**: Model stacking and blending for robustness
4. **Dynamic Rebalancing**: Portfolio reoptimization based on new loan issuances
5. **Stress Testing**: Scenario analysis for different economic conditions

**Estimated Impact**: 5-10% improvement in predictive accuracy, enhanced portfolio risk-adjusted returns.
