# Listing-Time Rule Analysis - Critical Issue Identified

## üö® **CRITICAL ISSUE: Listing-Time Rule Violation**

### **Problem Statement**

Our current implementation **violates the listing-time only rule** by using `loan_status` as the target variable. This field contains post-origination outcomes that would not be known at the time a loan is first listed.

### **Current Implementation Issue**

#### **What We're Currently Doing (INCORRECT):**
```python
# In feature_pipeline.py
def _create_target_variable(self, data: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    default_statuses = [
        'Charged Off',      # ‚Üê Post-origination outcome
        'Default',          # ‚Üê Post-origination outcome
        'Late (31-120 days)', # ‚Üê Post-origination outcome
    ]

    if 'loan_status' in data.columns:
        target = data['loan_status'].isin(default_statuses).astype(int)
        # This uses OUTCOMES from the SAME period as the FEATURES
```

#### **Data Flow Issue:**
```
2016Q1 Loans Listed ‚Üí Features Known ‚Üí loan_status Outcome Used Immediately
                    ‚Üë                    ‚Üì
              Listing Time          Post-Origination (Months Later)
```

### **Why This Violates the Rule**

The listing-time rule asks: *"Could this value exist before the first payment was ever made?"*

- **loan_status values like "Charged Off" or "Default"**: ‚ùå NO - these outcomes occur months/years after listing
- **Features like interest_rate, loan_amount**: ‚úÖ YES - known at listing time
- **Target should be**: Future outcomes observed after sufficient time has passed

### **Correct Implementation Required**

#### **Proper Temporal Separation:**
```python
# CORRECT APPROACH (Not Currently Implemented)
def create_temporal_target(loan_data, outcome_data, observation_window_months=12):
    """
    Create target variable using outcomes observed AFTER listing date + observation window

    Args:
        loan_data: Loans listed in period X
        outcome_data: Outcomes observed in period X + observation_window
        observation_window_months: Minimum months to observe outcomes
    """
    # For loans listed in 2016Q1, use outcomes from 2017Q1 onwards
    # This ensures outcomes are truly post-origination
```

#### **Required Changes:**

1. **Separate Data Sources:**
   - Features: From listing-time data (2016Q1-Q3)
   - Targets: From outcome observations (2017Q1-Q4)

2. **Observation Window:**
   - Minimum 12-24 months between listing and outcome observation
   - Ensures sufficient time for defaults to materialize

3. **Target Definition:**
   - Use actual performance outcomes, not current status
   - Consider censored observations (loans still performing)

### **Impact Assessment**

#### **Current Implementation Problems:**
- ‚úÖ **Features**: Correctly listing-time only
- ‚ùå **Target**: Uses post-origination outcomes immediately
- ‚ùå **Temporal Leakage**: Target reveals future information

#### **Real-World Consequences:**
- **Overestimated Performance**: Model appears better than it would be in reality
- **Invalid Predictions**: Cannot predict defaults at listing time (impossible)
- **Business Impact**: Misleading investment decisions

### **Required Fix**

#### **Immediate Actions Needed:**

1. **Remove loan_status from Target Creation:**
   ```python
   # Remove this problematic code
   if 'loan_status' in data.columns:
       target = data['loan_status'].isin(default_statuses).astype(int)
   ```

2. **Implement Proper Temporal Target:**
   ```python
   def create_listing_time_target(listing_data, future_outcome_data):
       # Match loans by ID across time periods
       # Use outcomes from 12-24 months after listing
       # Handle censored observations properly
   ```

3. **Data Structure Changes:**
   - Split data into: Features (listing-time) + Outcomes (future observations)
   - Implement observation window logic
   - Handle loans with insufficient observation time

#### **Alternative Approaches:**

1. **Proxy Target:** Use early indicators (e.g., 60+ days delinquent within 6 months)
2. **Survival Analysis:** Model time-to-default with censoring
3. **Separate Datasets:** Listing features + Future outcome observations

### **Validation Questions**

To verify proper implementation, ask:

1. **For a loan listed on 2016-01-01:**
   - What is the earliest date we can observe its `loan_status`?
   - Are we using outcomes from before this date? (Should be NO)

2. **Feature-Target Alignment:**
   - Can all feature values exist before first payment? (Should be YES)
   - Does target reveal post-origination information? (Should be NO)

3. **Business Logic:**
   - Could an investor make this prediction at listing time? (Should be YES)
   - Are we using "future information" to predict the "past"? (Should be NO)

## ‚úÖ **FIXED: Proper Temporal Target Implementation**

### **Solution Implemented**

#### **1. Temporal Target Creation Method**
**File**: `src/lending_club/feature_pipeline.py`

```python
def create_temporal_target(self, listing_data: pd.DataFrame,
                          outcome_quarters: List[str],
                          observation_window_months: int = 12) -> pd.Series:
    """
    Create proper listing-time target using outcomes from future periods.

    This implements the correct temporal approach where:
    - Features come from listing quarter (e.g., 2016Q1)
    - Targets come from future outcome observations (e.g., 2017Q1+)
    - Minimum observation window ensures sufficient time for defaults to occur
    """
```

#### **2. Pipeline Integration**
**File**: `main_pipeline.py`

Added temporal target creation as Step 2.5 in the pipeline:
```python
# Step 2.5: Create Temporal Targets (CRITICAL FIX)
print("üéØ Step 2.5/6: Creating temporal targets...")
data_dict = self._create_temporal_targets(data_dict)
```

#### **3. Configuration-Driven Setup**
**File**: `config/pipeline_config.yaml`

```yaml
temporal_targets:
  enabled: true  # Enable proper temporal target creation
  observation_windows:
    train: 12      # Minimum 12 months between listing and outcome for training
    validation: 6  # Minimum 6 months for validation
    backtest: 3    # Minimum 3 months for backtest (limited data availability)

  outcome_quarters:
    train: ["2017Q1", "2017Q2", "2017Q3", "2017Q4"]      # Outcomes for 2016Q1-Q3 listings
    validation: ["2017Q2", "2017Q3", "2017Q4"]           # Outcomes for 2016Q4 listings
    backtest: ["2017Q3", "2017Q4"]                       # Outcomes for 2017Q1 listings
```

### **Correct Implementation Flow**

#### **Before (BROKEN):**
```
2016Q1 Loans Listed ‚Üí Features + loan_status ‚Üí Model ‚ùå
                    ‚Üë                        ‚Üì
              Listing Time          Same Period Outcomes
```

#### **After (FIXED):**
```
2016Q1 Loans Listed ‚Üí Features ‚Üí Wait 12+ Months ‚Üí 2017 Outcomes ‚Üí Model ‚úÖ
                    ‚Üë                                      ‚Üì
              Listing Time                    Future Observations
```

### **Temporal Separation Details**

| Dataset | Listing Period | Outcome Period | Min Observation Window | Purpose |
|---------|----------------|----------------|----------------------|---------|
| **Train** | 2016Q1-Q3 | 2017Q1-Q4 | 12 months | Model training |
| **Validation** | 2016Q4 | 2017Q2-Q4 | 6 months | Hyperparameter tuning |
| **Backtest** | 2017Q1 | 2017Q3-Q4 | 3 months | Performance evaluation |

### **Key Implementation Features**

#### **1. Loan Matching Across Time**
```python
def _match_loans_temporal(self, listing_data: pd.DataFrame,
                         outcome_data: pd.DataFrame,
                         observation_window_months: int) -> pd.Series:
    # Match loans by ID between listing and outcome periods
    # Apply observation window constraints
    # Handle censored observations (loans with no outcome data)
```

#### **2. Censored Observation Handling**
- **Available Outcomes**: Loans with observed outcomes in future quarters
- **Censored Observations**: Loans without sufficient observation time
- **Default Assumption**: Censored loans assumed non-default (conservative approach)

#### **3. Outcome Data Loading**
- Dynamically loads outcome data from specified future quarters
- Combines multiple quarters for comprehensive outcome observation
- Handles missing data gracefully with fallbacks

### **Validation Questions - Now Answered ‚úÖ**
