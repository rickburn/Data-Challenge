# AI-Era Data Challenge - AI Usage Disclosure

## Overview
This document transparently reports all AI assistance used during this Lending Club data challenge project, following the requirement for AI-use transparency.

## AI Tools Used

### [Tool Name, e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot]
- **Version/Model**: [e.g., GPT-4, Claude-3, etc.]
- **Usage Dates**: [date range]

## Areas Where AI Was Used

### 1. Code Generation
**What was generated**:
- [ ] Boilerplate EDA code
- [ ] Data cleaning functions
- [ ] Model training scaffolding
- [ ] Plotting/visualization code
- [ ] Other: [specify]

**How it was validated**:
- [e.g., "Manually reviewed all generated functions and tested on sample data"]
- [e.g., "Compared AI-generated EDA plots with manual verification"]

### 2. Data Analysis & Interpretation
**What was assisted**:
- [ ] Feature engineering ideas
- [ ] Statistical interpretation
- [ ] Model evaluation metrics explanation
- [ ] Business logic validation
- [ ] Other: [specify]

**How it was validated**:
- [e.g., "Cross-referenced statistical interpretations with textbooks/documentation"]
- [e.g., "Validated feature engineering logic against domain knowledge"]

### 3. Documentation & Communication
**What was assisted**:
- [ ] Code comments and docstrings
- [ ] README/documentation writing
- [ ] Summary report structure
- [ ] Technical explanation clarity
- [ ] Other: [specify]

**How it was validated**:
- [e.g., "Reviewed all documentation for accuracy and completeness"]

### 4. Debugging & Problem Solving
**What was assisted**:
- [ ] Error diagnosis and fixing
- [ ] Performance optimization suggestions
- [ ] Code refactoring recommendations
- [ ] Logic flow improvements
- [ ] Other: [specify]

**How it was validated**:
- [e.g., "Tested all debugging solutions thoroughly before implementing"]

## AI Limitations Encountered

1. **[Limitation 1]**: [e.g., "AI suggested using future-looking features initially"]
   - **How addressed**: [e.g., "Manually reviewed all features for temporal validity"]

2. **[Limitation 2]**: [e.g., "Generated code had subtle logical errors"]
   - **How addressed**: [e.g., "Line-by-line code review and testing"]

## Human Validation Process

**Code Validation**:
- [ ] All AI-generated code manually reviewed
- [ ] Functions tested with sample data
- [ ] Logic verified against project requirements
- [ ] Performance and correctness validated

**Analysis Validation**:
- [ ] Statistical methods verified against documentation
- [ ] Results cross-checked with manual calculations
- [ ] Interpretations validated against domain knowledge
- [ ] Assumptions explicitly documented and justified

**Quality Assurance**:
- [ ] End-to-end pipeline tested for reproducibility
- [ ] Data leakage checks performed manually
- [ ] Temporal validation logic verified
- [ ] All guardrails compliance manually confirmed

## Original Contributions

**Areas of independent work**:
- [e.g., "Feature selection strategy and business logic"]
- [e.g., "Investment policy design and risk tolerance decisions"]
- [e.g., "Model interpretation and business insights"]
- [e.g., "Project structure and workflow design"]

## Transparency Statement

I acknowledge that AI tools were used as assistants in this project, but all final decisions, validations, and interpretations represent my own analytical thinking and judgment. Every AI-generated component was critically evaluated and validated through manual review and testing.

**Estimated AI vs Human Contribution**:
- AI-assisted: [X%] (primarily boilerplate, scaffolding, and syntax)
- Human-driven: [Y%] (analysis, decisions, validation, insights)
